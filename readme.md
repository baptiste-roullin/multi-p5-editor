# A p5js editor in VS code

A boilerplate project for a better p5js authoring experience. Basically it opens a Vue application in your browser and allows quick switching between experiments. New experiments (.vue files in the `views` folder) are automatically added to the navigation bar in Vue.

Motivation: There are other boilerplates out there, but they necessitate to duplicate a whole new project for each experiment.

2. `npm install`
3. Accept to install the file watching extension VS Code is suggesting.
chmod u+x new_files.sh
4. Run Vite
